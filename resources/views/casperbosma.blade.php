 The main reason why I started creating this website is cause I needed a CV and portfolio and thought this was a great way of combining both. I've really enjoyed creating my own website so far. Gives me allot of opportunities to be creative and try out new things.<br><br>
I started with making designs in photoshop of the website so I had a rough idea of what I wanted. Made a few variations of the design so I could pick what I liked best.<br><br>
Here are a few samples:<br><br>
When I started coding the website things turned out a little different cause I got new and better ideas while programming and wanted to apply those. What I liked most was creating the effects in CSS that make the page look amazing.<br>
